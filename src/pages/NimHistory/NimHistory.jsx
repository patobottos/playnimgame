            On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may
            remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same
            pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is
            either to take the last object or to avoid taking it (a{" "}

            in Wrocław, Poland for its Odra 1003. It was an adaption of the
            logic game of nim. Inspired by the discussion in the magazine

            , named "Marienbad" by the magazine, Podgórski programmed the game
            for the in-development 1003 mainframe, released in 1963. The game
            had players opposing the computer in alternating rounds of removing
            matches from a set, with the last player to take a match the loser.
            As the computer always played the optimal moves, it was essentially
            unbeatable.
